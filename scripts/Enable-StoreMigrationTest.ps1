<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Relabels a prerelease OpenClaw Companion (Inno) installation as a stable
    release so the Store app will offer the migration flow.

.DESCRIPTION
    The Store app refuses to migrate from an Inno registration whose
    DisplayVersion is a prerelease such as 2026.9.5-alpha.64. Every build that
    carries the migration payload today is a prerelease, so testing the flow
    requires relabelling the registration.

    Only two registry strings change. The installed binaries are untouched and
    remain genuine and signed. This is faithful because GitVersion stamps the
    prerelease binary with the stable core version already (alpha.64 ships
    FileVersion 2026.9.5.0), so every field the migration detector inspects
    matches a real stable build.

    The original values are saved under the same key and restored by -Revert.

.PARAMETER TargetVersion
    Stable version to present. Defaults to the core of the installed
    prerelease version, which is what a real stable build would carry.

.PARAMETER Revert
    Restore the original DisplayVersion and DisplayName.

.PARAMETER MoveBlockingFiles
    Move stray files out of the gateways folder so preparation can run. They
    are moved, not deleted, into a timestamped folder alongside it.

.PARAMETER ResetMigrationState
    Delete the store-migration records so the next launch re-evaluates from
    scratch. A finished migration consumes its own records, so this is only
    needed after a run that was interrupted part way through and left a
    stale consent or intent behind.

    The completion receipt is left alone. See -IncludeCompletionReceipt.

.PARAMETER IncludeCompletionReceipt
    Also delete completed.dpapi, the receipt that proves a migration finished.
    Leave this off unless you need a true cold start, because the gateway
    uninstaller reads the receipt to decide whether to preserve your WSL
    gateway. Without it, and with the Store app unregistered, uninstalling
    will unregister the distro and delete the generated state it holds.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\Enable-StoreMigrationTest.ps1
    Relabels 2026.9.5-alpha.64 as 2026.9.5.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\Enable-StoreMigrationTest.ps1 -Revert
    Puts the original prerelease label back.

.EXAMPLE
    .\scripts\Enable-StoreMigrationTest.ps1 -ResetMigrationState
    Clears a half-finished migration so the next test starts clean.

.NOTES
    Uninstalling the Inno app removes the key, so a completed migration needs
    no revert. Use -Revert only if you abandon the test before uninstalling.
